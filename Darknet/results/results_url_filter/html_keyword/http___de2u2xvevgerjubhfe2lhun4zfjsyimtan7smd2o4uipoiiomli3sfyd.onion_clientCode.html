  <center>NOTE: WE ARE NOT ACCEPTING ANY COLLABORATIONS, INTERVIEWS, OR THE LIKE AT THE TIME UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.</center>
  <center>For safety and privacy reasons we do not play live concerts as this can unmask our anonymity. However, our music is 50% computerized and 50% real instruments. Real instruments such as guitars and organs were played live then modified slightly to fit the songs, but not too much as to sound synthetic and fake.</center>
