### TRANSMISSION CONTENTS ###
This is Paul Goodwin. 

It has been one hell of a day. I don&#x27;t know how long I have been iced for, but 
today was the day to come back. I don&#x27;t know how much any outsider knows about 
cryopods, but it is not a pleasant awakening. An electrostimulus restarts the 
heart muscle and the other organs follow suit without much protest. First you 
feel the cold, but as soon as you move you feel your joints break from their 
cast of stillness, like a river running through ice. Headache, dizziness, and 
nausea all hit you at once as your eyes adjust and your body&#x27;s juices begin to 
flow again. I found that my cryopod is completely fried, which leaves me in a 
predicament. The rest of my crew is still iced, and that&#x27;s definitely for the 
better, because our destination is 200 years away at our current speed. It&#x27;s 
looking like currently I&#x27;m going to have to die on this ship. That&#x27;s all I can 
report on for now, but I&#x27;m going to see what I can do about my predicament.
